            ## Auto-generated SDK updates

            This PR was automatically created because proto files were modified.

            ### Changes
            - Regenerated SDK code from updated `.proto` files
            - Generated files are in `sdks/` directory

            ### Verification
            - [ ] Review generated code changes
            - [ ] Ensure SDK builds successfully
            - [ ] Test SDK functionality if needed
